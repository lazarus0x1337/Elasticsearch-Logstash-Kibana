# Enables Logstash to send monitoring data to Elasticsearch.
# Monitoring alerts you if Logstash stops or crashes.
# If Logstash fails to parse logs, monitoring can show:
# Dropped events (logs that didn't make it to Elasticsearch).
# Configuration errors (wrong Grok patterns, invalid JSON parsing).
# Connection issues (Elasticsearch unavailable, authentication failures).

# xpack.monitoring.enabled: true

#This tells Logstash to collect and forward internal metrics 
#(like event rates, pipeline performance, and error counts) to Elasticsearch for visualization in Kibana.
